            <h2 class="ds-heading">About Me</h2>
            <p>Senior Backend Software Engineer with over 9 years of experience designing, building, and deploying scalable, cloud-native solutions on AWS. Currently leading the Know Your Customer (KYC) team at Atelio by Fidelity Information Services, where I've built comprehensive KYC solutions from concept to deployment, incorporating document verification, device profiling, and real-time verification checks.</p>
            <p>Before joining Sunpower, I spent 4.5 years at Amazon, working on various customer-centric initiatives. As part of the team responsible for Alexa Show, I engineered multiple shopping functionalities including Buy, Search, Reorder, and Add to Cart features. My stint at Amazon also took me to the cutting-edge Amazon Go project for 2 years. There, I was instrumental in rearchitecting and scaling backend services, enabling the expansion from smaller storefronts to full-fledged Amazon Go Grocery outlets.</p>
            <p>I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, graduating in 2017. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me strumming my guitar, exploring new destinations, or engrossed in a good book. I'm also a devoted dog owner who relishes quality time with my furry friend.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Architected, built, and deployed an innovative chat platform integrated within the My Sunpower app. Leveraging artificial intelligence, the system intelligently understands customer queries to recommend relevant articles for immediate issue resolution. For more complex or unique concerns where a pre-existing article doesn't suffice, the platform effortlessly routes the customer to a live agent for personalized assistance, either via chat or a callback feature. This solution currently serves approximately <b>5,000</b> customers, with around <b>4,500</b> of them being seamlessly connected to live agents on a weekly basis.</li>
                  <li>Developed a robust platform integrated into the My Sunpower app that empowers customers to effortlessly monitor the progress of their Customer Care Cases. Users can not only initiate a new case but also contribute comments and, if necessary, request a connection to a live agent. This solution is actively utilized by around <b>2,000</b> customers weekly and has contributed to more than <b>10%</b> reduction in call volumes for our care agents.</li>
                  <li>Played a pivotal role in transforming Sunpower's customer support infrastructure by phasing out the old contact center and developing an innovative, in-house solution utilizing Amazon Connect. Spearheaded the initiative to migrate an extensive dataset of 5.7 million customer call recordings and related metadata from the legacy system to AWS S3. This ensured seamless accessibility and efficient data retrieval. This strategic move significantly optimized infrastructure and operational costs, cutting down the annual expenses of our contact center from $1.2 million to $500,000 in 2023. This strategic overhaul resulted in substantial annual savings of $700,000.</li>
